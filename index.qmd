## Introduction

As I round off my fourth and final year pursuing a Bachelor of Commerce in Finance at the University of Alberta, I'm eager to share some of the projects I've been working on. My focus areas include trading, risk management, and data analytics.

This website serves as a portfolio of my recent endeavors, with updates added regularly as I complete new projects. I invite you to explore the work I've assembled here. Thank you for taking the time to explore my portfolio!
