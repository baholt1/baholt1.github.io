    "text": "This project aims to discover whether commodity prices can be used in the short term to predict changes in the Canadian Dollar. We analyze the correlation between an index of export commodities and the Canadian Dollar to create an optimal trading strategy.\nThis project implements linear models to find a relationship between commodity price movements and its impact on the future CAD/USD exchange rate.\nOur model displays its predictive ability both in the training period and holdout data. Our strategy yields a 3.26% cumulative return in out-of-sample holdout data from August 20, 2021 to present, outperforming a buy and hold strategy by 11.5%.
